CRUD Operations for Product Database Using Mongoose

Objective: Learn how to implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a Node.js application using MongoDB and Mongoose.

Product Model: Define a structured schema for products with fields like name, price, and category, ensuring proper validations.

Database Connection: Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for smooth and secure data operations.

Create Operation: Add new products to the database with all necessary details.

Read Operation: Retrieve and display all products or specific products based on criteria.

Update Operation: Modify existing product details using a unique identifier (ID).

Delete Operation: Remove products from the database using their ID.

Error Handling: Implement checks and validations to handle incorrect or missing data effectively.

Data Integrity: Ensure that only valid and structured data is stored in the database.

Scalability: Demonstrates a scalable approach to handling real-world product data.

Practical Application: Provides hands-on experience in building a backend system that interacts with a database.

Outcome: A fully functional RESTful API capable of performing all CRUD operations, ready for integration into larger applications.

Learning Benefits: Understand schema design, data validation, routing, and handling asynchronous operations with Mongoose.
